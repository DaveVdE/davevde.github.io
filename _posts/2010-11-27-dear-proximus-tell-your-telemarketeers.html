I had a call, the other day. It was a blocked number. I don't usually answer blocked numbers. They're usually telemarketeers. I hate telemarketeers. I don't want to answer the phone when it's a telemarketeer. But you're not really sure, right? So they called again, the day after. I answered, figuring that if I didn't answer, this would go on and on.<br />
<br />
It was Proximus, my mobile carrier. The nice voice on the other line started like this: "Hello sir, we've done an analysis of your mobile usage. This won't take long. Can I ask you, how much do you pay, on average, every month?".<br />
<br />
I thought to myself, if they've done an analysis, they probably know more about my usage than me, since I rarely check my phonebill. I'll spare you the details, but everything else was a plot to trick me into signing up to a different plan that would stick for 18 months where I would pay a lot more than what I pay today. Her words: "that's not so bad, is it?"<br />
<br />
Hmmm..... no thanks.
