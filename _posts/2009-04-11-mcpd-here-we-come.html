Today I passed MCP exam 70-528, so I've earned the credential &quot;MCTS .NET 2.0: Web Applications&quot;. This is one step closer to MCPD. While preparing for the exam, I used Transcender's study guide and preparation tests, and it really made a difference. For the last exam, 70-536, I used the ones included with the exam guide, and then bought into MeasureUP's preparation tests, but they were very frustrating. So if you're busy getting ready for certification, you should really check out those Transcender's tests.
