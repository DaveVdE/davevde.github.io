<p>I like <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>. He's an interesting guy, and he writes interesting stuff, and I've been reading him for years now. I'm subscribed to his mailing list, but it had gotten awful quiet for a long while now. I also like <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/">ASP.NET MVC</a>, and I really enjoyed watching Phil Haack's <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC21/">presentation</a> on the subject. Jeff Atwood was in that presentation as well. I had been reading his blog for a couple months. It was nice to finally put a face to the blog. So then I found out that Joel and Jeff were in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> thing together. Wow! And they have a podcast? I love podcasts! </p>  <p>They make me a safer driver, particularly because I don't pay so much attention to all the idiots on the road anymore. The radio is just plain boring these days. So I decided to tune in to the podcast, and I loved it. But then I had to go and download all previous thirty something episodes of it and listen to them in the right order to catch up. Which is what I've been doing for the last two weeks. </p>  <p>Now I'm at episode 34, and even though it's been fun to listen, I do get a bit<span style="font-style: italic"> <span style="font-style: italic">saturated</span></span>. It's as if everytime I'm reading something, it's Jeff Atwood's voice in my head <span style="font-style: italic">narrating the text</span> to me. So Jeff, if you're reading this, I think you should start narrating interesting stuff to read, because you have a really nice voice that goes well with technical stuff, so that I can listen to your audiobooks while in the car.</p>
