This week I passed 70-549, concluding my series of exams to earn the MCPD Enterprise Application Developer certification.

I would like to thank <a href="http://blog.briandicroce.com/2008/10/22/the-road-towards-mcpd-ead-i-passed-exam-70-528-70-526-and-70-549-mission-accomplished/">Brian</a> to point me to the Transcender preparation exams. They are really a lot harder than the exams themselves, and the answers try to teach you something at the same time.
