<p>For my next project, I'm looking into using a Dependency Injection framework. For those of you who don't know what it is, I would like to forward you to <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">this article</a> from Martin Fowler. The book I'm reading uses <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html">Castle Windsor</a>, but it hasn't been updated in a while so I'm looking into others, like the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc468366.aspx">Unity</a> application block. </p>  <p>I came across <a href="http://www.ninject.com">Ninject</a> lately (thanks to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21288/which-c-net-dependency-injection-frameworks-are-worth-looking-into">StackOverflow</a>) but it seems awkward to choose for a DI framework without the ability to configure it from outside the code.</p>
