<p>I was trying out Resharper this week. I saw it being used on some screencast and thought &quot;wow, that sounds like something useful&quot;, but after a week I gotta say, it just kept getting in my way. You have to understand my typing skills. </p>  <p>I'm over-confident when I type. I can type blind easily, but I do tend to speed up too fast (partly because my brain is always ahead of my fingers) so I do make typing errors all the time. That does not work well with this tool. It's like in Visual Studio... when you accidentally tab twice but only meant like once (like when you want to indent something) and when you backspace it, you have to hit backspace <span style="font-style: italic">four times</span> because it's already converted into spaces. That sort of lame, but much worse. And it also tries to give you little programmer hints, like suggesting to make private members <span style="font-style: italic">readonly</span> just because it can't find any code that tries to modify it. </p>  <p>Yes, I know, it's probably a good thing to do when you don't, but I'm currently trying to implement this feature and I get distracted easily already so I don't really want to spend time thinking about that <span style="font-style: italic">right now</span>. I'm sure you can set all these options left and right. But that's besides the point. It's a productivity tool, not something I want to spend half my time with just to train it. The blind person gets the <span style="font-style: italic">trained</span> guide dog and is not supposed to train it, y'know?</p>
